# VQC - Virtual Quantum Computing

![QVM](./docs/intro.png)

QVM is a framework for virtual optimization and distributed execution of quantum cricuits. It builds on the work of 
"Constructing a virtual two-qubit gate by sampling single-qubit operations" [[1]](#1) to allow transparent use of
binary gate virtualization, both in order to mitigate noise and allow executions of large quantum circuits on small quantum devices.

This project started from a [Bachelor's thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TUM-DSE/research-work-archive/main/archive/2022/summer/docs/bsc_tornow_dqs_a_framework_for_efficient_distributed_simulation_of_large_quantum_circuits.pdf) at TU Munich.

## Installation
```shell
pip install vqc
```

## Getting Started
